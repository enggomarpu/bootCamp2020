Bootstrap ships with 4 tiers of grids, which have class prefixes of;

.col-xs- , (<768px)

.col-sm- , (≥768px)

.col-md- , (≥992px)

.col-lg- , (≥1200px)

If you've applied a column class of "col-xs-6" what you are saying is that from 0px to 767px i want this column to be 50% of the containers width. And unless you add another class for the next grid tier, it will continue to be 50% of the parent on wider screens as well. So not only up to 768px but beyond unless you add another class.

Your problem here is that most mobiles are simply too narrow to show two columns for this purpose. So change "col-xs-6" to "col-xs-12". And add "col-sm-6" as well.

<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">
That will mean that from 768px and up, the columns wil be 50%.

The reason why the layout looks broken though is probably because your input's have a width or min-width that is greater than the 50% width of the container and are therefore wider than the column grid they are nested in.
